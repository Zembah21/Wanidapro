# I'm Wanida Taptim-aon from Thailand. You can call me Zembah.

I want everyone to know that I can fully apply the khowledgement i have learned, whether in waste(water, air, Hazardous, Trash) treatment- management and design, safety, EIA and all my academic skills will solve problems to reduce cost and increase the efficiency of utility system.

And I'm also a person who is easy to get along with my colleagues and always ready to learn things. Because I believe that I have to keep improving myself.
